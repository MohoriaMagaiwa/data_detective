📊 Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib
📝 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to load, explore, analyze, and visualize data using two powerful Python libraries — pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib for data visualization.

It’s designed to help beginners understand how to:

Work with datasets (CSV format)

Perform basic statistical analysis

Detect and handle missing values

Build beautiful charts to present insights

We use the Iris dataset as a sample dataset, but you can easily replace it with any dataset of your choice (sales, students, employees, etc.)

🎯 Objectives

Load and explore a dataset using Pandas.

Perform basic data analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, grouping, etc.).

Create visualizations with Matplotlib (line, bar, histogram, scatter).

Customize plots with titles, axis labels, and legends.

Handle common data issues like missing values and wrong data types.

📈 Visualizations Included

Line Chart: Time series trends

Bar Chart: Comparison across categories

Histogram: Data distribution

Scatter Plot: Relationship between two variables

Each plot is styled with seaborn themes and customized titles, axis labels, and legends.

⚡ Error Handling

The project includes:

Try/except blocks for file reading

Checks for missing values using .isnull().sum()

Cleaning strategies: filling or dropping NaN values

💡 Key Learnings

How to inspect a dataset using .head(), .info(), .describe()

How to group data using .groupby()

How to build and customize plots in Matplotlib

How to extract insights and communicate results visually

🏁 Conclusion

This project is a beginner-friendly guide to data analysis and visualization in Python. By completing it, you’ll gain hands-on experience in data handling and storytelling with charts — a vital skill in data science.
